## About
Fast-growing vehicles and limited parking lots have caused Open Parking and Camera Violation problems. Parking disorderly not only brings inconvenience to traffic flow but also has a negative impact on the image of the city.The purpose of our research is to evaluate several factors that are associated with the violations that happened. From our analysis, we would come up with improvements for pedestrians, vehicular safety through education and a timely decision of Parking, and traffic violations. Further, it would help the government to resolve violation issues in a systematic manner. 

We obtained the dataset from NYC Open Data website - https://data.cityofnewyork.us/view/i4p3-pe6a

## Technologies
* Python (Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib) 
* Microsoft Excel

## Conclusion
* Achieved an accuracy of 76% using a refined neural network, random forest and decision tree models on 23.6M traffic violations and predicted violation type (i.e, parking, camera, meter, plate, no standing, other). 
* Proposed suggestions to reduce traffic violations based on results of statistical analysis of factors causing parking and camera violations.
